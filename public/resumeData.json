    "bio":"Ever since I was young, I was always passionate about thinking of cool products and building them. It was definitely no accident when I started my career as a mechanical engineer working in the automotive industry. I recently transitioned to be a software engineer after seeing how quickly the tech industry was moving and I didn't want to miss out in being a part of it. Additionally, I realized how much I genuinely like coding. I enjoy finding unique solutions to solve modern problemsand as a software engineer, I'm grateful of the idea of being a forever student while continuously growing my skills every day.",
